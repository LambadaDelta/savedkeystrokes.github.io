title: "Skills: Insights with Sheryl Sandberg"
---

Out of all the podcasts I listen to, I would say that this is one that I regularly look forward to, it doesnt relate much to my day to day, but I have been able to take small ideas and apply them to my day to day.

One of the recent episodes I listened to was a recent upload of a bonus [full interview Reid Hoffman had with Sheryl Sandberg](https://art19.com/shows/masters-of-scale/episodes/90a43532-8195-4d57-b53b-3098d8a69b40)
