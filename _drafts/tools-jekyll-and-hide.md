# Tools: creating a blog using github and Jekyll

A friend of mine was recently having an issue with WordPress, I have a site there myself, but other people who heard about this asked why he wasnt using github to service a static site, this got me intregued.

I started off by performing a basic search for what this was, and found about the default provision of a site via github was really straight forward and would allow you have a basic site setup in next to no time, it would even be hosted as a subdomain under github.io, so you get to feel like you are speciall with an io domain for free.
